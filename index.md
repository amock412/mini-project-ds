## Mini Project Data Science Task

As part of the <a href="https://www.hackdiversity.com/">Hack.Diversity Fellowship</a> the Mini Project involves implementing a small local coffee shop has a community library app where anyone can borrow books. 

As part of the data science track, one's task is to examine the book data of available books in the community library as well as trends in book borrowing. To evaluate the the books as wells as borrowing trends we were given two datasets, one containing all the books in the libary as well as another one that contains the weekly borrowings for the top 106 books. 

Here I will provide a brief overview of the data exploration I did, the jupyter notebooks containing all of the code can be found
